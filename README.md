# Kuwan Backend Stack

Work-in-progress (still under development)

Note: Currently in the "development stage". Breaking changes are introduced without following semantic versioning.

A TypeScript backend stack for building backend applications powered by Express.js.

> _Ano gamit nyong backend?. Ahh... yung kuwan, yung kuwan. ExpressJS, tapos may kuwan, mga kuwan._

## Packages

- `lite`: Core express app wrapper with utilities. Contains package and utils that are re-usable for Express applications. Rather than creating a mini-framework on top of Express, this package provides utilities and configurations that can be used in any Express application.
